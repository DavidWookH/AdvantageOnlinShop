# introduction to unittest framework
# Python has 2 common testing frameworks
# Framework 1 is called Unittest - it's a built in framework, no need to install
# Framework 2 is called Pytest - it's an external library and needs to be installed

# to use Unittest add import to the top of the file - import unittest
